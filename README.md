# driver2vec
Reproduction of original paper "Driver2vec: Driver Identification from Automotive Data" by J. Yang.
The original paper worked on a large dataset of 50 drivers, however they have shared only dataset of 5 drivers.
So this work is done only on a partial dataset, which leads to less accuracy, the original paper reached an accuracy of 83%, and our model reached 70%
